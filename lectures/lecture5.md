#### What is UML?
 UML(Unified Modelling Language) is a way of **visualizing and documenting a software system** by using a collection of diagrams, which helps engineers, businesspeople, and system architects **understand the behavior and structure** of the system being designed.

---
#### Benefits of using UML:
1. Helps develop a quick understanding of a software system.
2. UML modeling helps in breaking a complex system into discrete pieces that can be easily understood.
3. UML’s graphical notations can be used to communicate design decisions.
4. Since UML is independent of any specific platform or language or technology, it is easier to abstract out concepts.
5. It becomes easier to hand the system over to a new team.

#### Types of UML diagrams

---
#### Class Diagram
- Used to describe structure and behavior in the use cases, this diagram provides a conceptual model of the system in terms of entities and their relationships.
---

##### Perspectives (Levels of specification)
- **Conceptual:** Describes "entities of the real world," language-independent.
- **Specification:** Describes "abstractions of software or components with specification and interfaces but without any reference to a specific implementation."
- **Implementation:** Describes "software implementations in a particular technology or programming language."

#### Sequence Diagram:
Used to describe interactions among classes in terms of an exchange of messages over time

#### Deployment diagram
Models the "physical aspect of an object-oriented software system," showing "**system architecture as deployment** or distribution of software artifacts."
