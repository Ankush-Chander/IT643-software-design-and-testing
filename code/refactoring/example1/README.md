# Example 1
Image a company of theatrical players who go out to various events performing
plays. Typically, a customer will request a few plays and the company charges
them based on the size of the audience and the kind of play they perform. There
are currently two kinds of plays that the company performs: tragedies and
comedies. As well as providing a bill for the performance, the company gives its
customers “volume credits” which they can use for discounts on future perfor-
mances—think of it as a customer loyalty mechanism.
